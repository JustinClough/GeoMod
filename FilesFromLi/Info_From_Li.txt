Here's the link to download the files: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n6l6xc21odm41nu/AAB5kpBXyO2uK40h6fY8XEUQa?dl=0. 

beadDisplacements_TecplotFormat.dat: tracking beads information.
Cell1_2000Facet_2D_01.inp: cell surface mesh.
Cell1_2000Facet_Linear_match2ref_01.inp: matrix volume mesh and a few other things.
Cell1_GFP_01.smooth.stl: cell geometry.
gel.vtk: vtk file created from their mesh.
gelRemesh_20more.vtk: our mesh created by constraining the mesh vertices on the tracking beads and adding more vertices to maintain the mesh quality.

Basically what you need is only the .dat and .stl files. The other files are only for your reference. Let me know if you have any doubts.
